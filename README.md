Proposed way to present methods for the Fusarium in Oat paper.

Additional code would be:

* OatOmics
* Scripts used by the Snakemake workflow

Data files

Depending of what makes more sense it could be stored here or under ComputationalProteomics. I keep it here for now as my account allows private repositories.
